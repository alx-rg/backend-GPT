All service interfaces could be LLMs too. Do you really need static structures if you have an LLM for on-the-fly mapping of any structure / language to any other?

Text is actually the universal interface--

LLMs allow all taxonomy / classification / tagging related bolt-ons to domain entities to not only be lifted out and decoupled, but now they're much more flexible.

Imagine a domain event like a purchase, and an artifact like a receipt.

Anyone currently tagging that receipt for some secondary analysis no longer needs any hard-coded representations of the mapping logic or the tags-- outside of the prompt.

I think someday soon you won't really need complex analytics platforms to ask questions of data and get profound answers. As LLM arch and prompts improve, most of the work of loading, transformation, and even data cleaning could be just telling an LLM what you need as an interface to what is.
